My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions

* [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) - developed with Python 3.10
  * All the solutions are grouped in separate, day-specific directories. Each part of the daily task has its own file.
  * Yes, sometimes the files are 99% the same and differ only with one value of one of the variables
  * All the input files are actually committed and pushed together with the code
  * Depending on the time I had to work on the solutions, the complexity of the problem, and other factors, the code quality might differ between the solutions.
* 2023 - Go
  * waiting for it ;)

Feel free to reach me and ask about the code and the solutions, they are 100% hand-written with love, and no AI tools were used to develop them :)
